#### A guide covering CUDA including the applications and tools that will make you a better and more efficient CUDA developer.

## Resources

[CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general computing on graphical processing units (GPUs). With CUDA, developers are able to dramatically speed up computing applications by harnessing the power of GPUs. In GPU-accelerated applications, the sequential part of the workload runs on the CPU, which is optimized for single-threaded. The compute intensive portion of the application runs on thousands of GPU cores in parallel. When using CUDA, developers can program in popular languages such as C, C++, Fortran, Python and MATLAB.

[NVIDIA NGC](https://ngc.nvidia.com/) is a hub for GPU-optimized software for deep learning, machine learning, and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads.

[NVIDIA NGC Containers](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/containers/) is a registry that provides researchers, data scientists, and developers with simple access to a comprehensive catalog of GPU-accelerated software for AI, machine learning and HPC. These containers take full advantage of NVIDIA GPUs on-premises and in the cloud.
